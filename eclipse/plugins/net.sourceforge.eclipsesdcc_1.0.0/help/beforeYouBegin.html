<h1>Before you begin</h1>

<p>You need the eclipse/CDT plugin. Use the following URL in a Site Bookmark in the eclipse update manager: 
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/eclipse3.1">http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/eclipse3.1 </a>.
Alternatively you can download eclipse/CDT manually from <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/eclipse3.1">The CDT download page</a>
</p>

<p>The eclipseSDCC can be installed on all platforms that support both the
eclipse IDE and the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC). In order to work
correctly follow the instructions for your platform.</p>

<h2 class="blue">Win32 Platforms</h2>


<p>If you do not already have SDCC installed download sdcc-win32 from
the SDCC download page on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=599">SourceForge</a>.
You can install SDCC into any convenient directory.</p>

<p>There is <b>no need</b> to install cygwin if you just want to build
for embedded targets. The eclipseSDCC plugin comes with a built-in make
utility that will be used automatically by the eclipse/CDT managed make
system. If you have cygwin installed it will be ignored when building
embedded targets using the managed make system.</p>

<p>To confirm that the SDCC compiler is working open a DOS window and
simply type:</p>

<pre class="snippet"> sdcc --help<br></pre>

<p>You should see the SDCC compiler respond with its help information.</p>




<h2 class="blue">Linux and other SDCC supported platforms</h2>

<p>If you do not already have SDCC installed download sdcc-xxx for your
platform from the SDCC download page on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=599">SourceForge</a>.
</p>

<p>To confirm that the SDCC compiler is working open a terminal window and
simply type:</p>

<pre class="snippet"> sdcc --help<br></pre>

<p>You should see the SDCC compiler respond with its help information.</p>

<p>The eclipseSDCC plugin for Linux and other platforms uses the host

they are installed correctly by typing.</p>
<pre class="snippet"> make --help<br> rm --help<br></pre>
