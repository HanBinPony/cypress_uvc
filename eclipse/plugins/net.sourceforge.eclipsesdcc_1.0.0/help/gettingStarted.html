<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>If you have not already done so read <a href="beforeYouBegin.html">"Before
you begin"</a> to make sure all the required software components are in
place for your platform.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with eclipse/CDT you should browse the C/C++
Development User Guide for information on CDT system basics.</p>

<h2 id="project" class="blue">Creating an Embedded C Project</h2>

<p>EclipseSDCC supports CDT managed make projects. In managed make
projects CDT manages the build process by creating and maintaining the
underlaying makefiles. CDT keeps track of source dependencies and can
automatically rebuild the target when needed.</p>

<ol>
  <li class="para">
  <p class="para">Create your first managed make project. From the menu
  bar, select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</b></p>
  <p class="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard1.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p clsss="para">In the New Project wizard, select <b>C</b> <strong>&gt;</strong>
  <b>Managed Make C Project</b> then click <b>Next</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p clsss="para">In the <b> Project name </b> field, type your name as
  the name of your new project. Do not use spaces or special characters
  in the project name (for example, "test1").</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <p clsss="para">Leave the box checked to use the default location for
  your new project. Click <b>Next</b> when you are done.</p>
  <p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard2.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p clsss="para">In the <b>Project Type </b> select "MCS851 family (SDCC)".
   Click <b>Finish</b> when you are done.</p>
  <p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard3.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p clsss="para">You may be asked if you want to change to the C/C++ perspective. Answer
  yes.</p>
  <p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard4.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
  </li>
  
</ol>

<p clsss="para">If all has gone well you should now see a project named test1 in the
C/C++ project viewer.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard5.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>


<p>Check that eclipseSDCC has correctly determined the default include paths used
by the SDCC compiler. These will be seen in the C/C++ project view in the "Includes" folder.</p>


<p>Take a while to familiarise yourself with the environment. Open some on the include files by double-clicking 
on them. They will be opened in the editor window. Also note the Outline view.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard6.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
    
<p>The outline view tracks the content of the editor window. The editor will track selections made in
the outline. This allows you to move quickly around your code.</p>    

<h2 id="source" class="blue">Creating C Source files</h2>

<p>Source files are held in source folders. Source folders can be nested to any depth allowing you to
organize your code logically. To create a source folder select the parent project in the C/C++ project view and 
right-click. In the pop up menu select select <b>New &gt; Source Folder</b>. Enter a suitable 
name for your source folder and click Finish.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard7.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>

<p>Select the newly created source folder and right-click. In the pop up menu
select select <b>New &gt; Source File</b>.  Enter a suitable 
name for your source file and click Finish.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard8.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>


<p>The managed make system will attempt to build your source. Inspect the console view to
check that this has happened.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard9.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>

<h2 id="errors" class="blue">SDCC Compiler Errors</h2>

<p>SDCC compile errors are highlighted in several places.</p>
<p clsss="para"><img src="images/GettingStarted_new_project_wizard10.png" alt="New Project Wizard" border="0"></p>
<p>The problems view lists errors in the order they were generated by the SDCC compiler. Double-click
on an error to open the source file at the offending line.

</p><p>In the editor window they are shown as red markers. You can hover over these markers to get the error message.</p>

<p>Errors are also shown in the C/C++ projects view and in the outline view.</p>

<h2 id="next" class="blue">What next</h2>
<p>Use the Eclipse platform and CDT help documentation to find your way around Eclipse and to resolve
generic 'C' problems. Additional help pages are avilable within eclipseSDCC but these only
related to eclipseSDCC specific issues.</p>

<p>Eclipse is a fantastic and very stable environment in which to work. As well as 'C' 
development have a look at the thousands of other plugins that you can download. You'll never go back!</p>
